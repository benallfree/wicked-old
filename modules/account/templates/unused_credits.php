Don't forget to schedule your lesson :)
You have credits for live private lessons, but you haven't scheduled a lesson.

Go schedule them at http://coaching.benallfree.com/my/schedule

Lessons work on a "lesson credit" system. You can apply your lesson credits toward any time slot. You can stack them, spread them out, skip a week, or double down. One person even did a stack of 4 (i.e., 1 hour 20 minutes!).

Free live private lessons are my way of saying thanks for helping to build the pirate ship. If you have trouble booking a time or can't find a time that works, please contact me.
